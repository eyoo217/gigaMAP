GIGA MAP PORT SCANNER

gigaMAP is a port scanner inspired by the nmap scanner that returns any open ports on a network.

gigaMAP takes in a website url or an ip address as a parameter and returns open ports and the ports status.

to run, install the main.go file
make sure go is installed (you can test this by typing go version)
run "go run main.go"

now you can scan ports with ease using gigaMAP!
